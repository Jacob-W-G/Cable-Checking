# Cable-Checking
Tested a ethernet cable because it was suppost to be 1GB per second but was giving 100mb per second.

First I learned how the connection runs in the building using a diagram.

Then was told what cable were wanting to check so first checked the ports on the endpoints and both ran at 1GB.

After knowing the ports were ok then the cable was tested to see if it was faulty. 

I used a cable tester to test if the cable was ok.

When the test was complete I found out the cable was terminated incorrectly.

After this was discovered it was reported to need replaced or reterminated.
